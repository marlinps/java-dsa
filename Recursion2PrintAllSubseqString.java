/* TODO: Print all subsequences of a string
    * 1. Base case: if the index is equal to the length of the string, print the current subsequence.
    * 2. Recursive case: if the index is less than the length of the string, print the current subsequence and call the function again with the index incremented by 1. 
    * 3. Call the function again with the index incremented by 1 and the current character added to the subsequence.
    * 4. Print the current subsequence.
    input: "abc"
