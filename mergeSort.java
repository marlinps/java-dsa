/* TODO: Merge Sort Implementation in Java
 *  This code implements the merge sort algorithm, which is a divide-and-conquer algorithm for sorting an array.
 *  It recursively divides the array into halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
 *  The time complexity of merge sort is O(n log n) and the space complexity is O(n).
