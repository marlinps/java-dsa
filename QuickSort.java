/* TODO: QuickSort
    * QuickSort is a divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by selecting a 'pivot' element and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.
    * It has a time complexity of O(n log n) and a space complexity of O(log n).
    * The algorithm works as follows:
    * 1. Choose a pivot element from the array.
    * 2. Partition the array into two sub-arrays: one with elements less than the pivot, and one with elements greater than or equal to the pivot.
    * 3. Recursively apply the same logic to the sub-arrays.
    * 4. Combine the sorted sub-arrays to get the final sorted array.
    * 
    * Example: [5, 2, 8, 1, 3] -> [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]   
    * * Note: The choice of pivot can affect the performance of the algorithm. Common strategies include choosing the first element, the last element, or a random element as the pivot.
