 * TODO: Print all combinations of a string
 * 1. Base case: if the index is equal to the length of the string, print the current combination.  
 * 2. Recursive case: if the index is less than the length of the string, print the current combination and call the function again with the index incremented by 1.
 * 3. Call the function again with the index incremented by 1 and the current character added to the combination.
